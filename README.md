  * In our age of unparalleled technological advancement, it is important that we address the social and ethical considerations that these advances engender. **Ethics for the Information Age** takes a thoughtful approach that considers not only the short-term benefits of technology, but possible long-term effects as well. Such an approach requires a solid grounding in ethics and logic, an understanding of the history of technology and a familiarity with current and cutting-edge information technology.
 
* The **8th Edition** is extensively updated and covers many new developments and controversies related to the introduction, use and misuse of information technology in modern society. New content focuses on the structure of logical arguments and common logical fallacies. It also includes practical advice about how to enhance privacy and security.
